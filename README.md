# Figma Plugin - Stripe Integration
Very simple boiler plate to start receiving payments directly on your Figma Plugin using Stripe.

### How to use:
This project is super simple. It's a Stripe Element input that allows you to receive payments directly on your Figma Plugin. Note that you need to implement the server side to have a fully integrated solution. 

Stripe instructions can be found here: [https://stripe.com/docs/js/initializing](https://stripe.com/docs/js/initializing)


After cloning this project, run:

```
npm install
```

For Webpack to watch for changes while you edit your code, do:

```
npx webpack --mode=development --watch
```
